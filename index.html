                <p>
                    My name is Rahmat Amiri, and I am currently studying Software Development 
                    at the University of South Australia. I have been living in Australia for 
                    the past three years and have enjoyed every moment of this life-changing 
                    journey. Before starting my degree, I successfully completed a university
                    preparatory program at the University of Adelaide, which helped me build
                    a strong academic foundation. I have always had a deep interest in 
                    technology and how it shapes the world around us. Web development, in particular,
                    excites me because of its creativity, problem-solving, and real-world 
                    applications. I enjoy learning new programming languages, designing 
                    user-friendly interfaces, and building projects from scratch.
                    My goal is to become a skilled software developer who creates practical
                     and meaningful solutions for people and businesses.

                <h2>My First-Year Experience :</h2>
                <p>
                    Through my university studies and personal projects, I have gained valuable 
                    hands-on experience in software development. I have worked on building 
                    simple websites, connecting them to databases, and applying responsive design 
                    principles. I have also participated in group assignments that helped me develop 
                    teamwork and version control skills using Git. By solving coding challenges 
                    and debugging different types of errors, I have improved my logical thinking 
                    and problem-solving abilities. These experiences have strengthened my interest 
                    in technology and motivated me to keep learning and growing as a developer.

                    My main learning goal is to become a skilled full-stack web developer.
                    I am focused on mastering both front-end and back-end technologies, 
                    including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and SQL. I also aim to gain 
                    experience with frameworks like React and Django to build dynamic, 
                    user-friendly web applications. I want to strengthen my understanding 
                    of software engineering principles, improve my coding efficiency, 
                    and develop the ability to design scalable and secure systems. In t
                    he long term, my goal is to contribute to real-world software projects 
                    and prepare myself for a professional career in the tech industry.

                        The university with a green environment features lush trees, 
                        extensive grass lawns, and vibrant plant life that create a peaceful and 
                        inviting atmosphere. These natural elements not only enhance the campus's 
                        aesthetic appeal but also provide shade, improve air quality, and support 
                        biodiversity. Walking through tree-lined pathways and open grassy areas offers 
                        students and staff a tranquil space to relax, study, or socialize outdoors. 
                        Such environments promote physical and mental well-being by offering a soothing 
                        escape from busy academic routines. Trees and greenery also help in reducing 
                        noise pollution and regulate campus temperatures naturally. Many universities 
                        take pride in maintaining well-kept gardens, flower beds, and natural landscapes 
                        that encourage environmental appreciation and biodiversity conservation. 
                        By preserving and increasing green coverage, these campuses foster a sense of harmony 
                        with nature, making the university a healthier, more sustainable place for everyone. 
                        This focus on greenery highlights the importance of a natural, eco-friendly campus 
                        environment.

                    As a full-time Software Development student at the University of South Australia,
                    my weekly schedule is a balanced mix of lectures, tutorials, and self-study.
                    I usually attend 3 to 4 classes each week, covering core subjects like Programming,
                    Web Development, Database Design, and Software Engineering Principles. Mornings
                    are often dedicated to lectures, while afternoons are reserved for coding practice,
                    lab sessions, or group assignments. I also set aside time every evening to review
                    materials and work on projects. My weekends are mostly free, which I use to revise,
                    explore tech topics, or relax and recharge.
